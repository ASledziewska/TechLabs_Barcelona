# TechLabs Barcelona
This repository contains projects and notebooks created during the Artificial Intelligence TechLabs Academy Track at TechLabs Barcelona. 

This project was created with Python 3.7.

## Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets - TechLabs_Final_Project.ipynb
This group project is based on a kaggle competition (www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) aiming at analysing tweets and determining if they are related to a disaster or not. To perform this analysis, three datasets are needed: train.csv, test.csv and sample_submission.csv, which are provided in this repository. The aim is to analyze the tweets and predict their context using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The whole analysis with explanatory comments can be found in the notebook TechLabs_Final_Project.ipynb.


## Techlabs Artificial Intelligence Exam - Techlabs_Artificial_Intelligence_Exam.ipynb
This notebook is a solved artificial intelligence exam that was conducted after finishing individual training tracks in AI and before being qualified for the final group projects. It tested our knowledge in Logistic Regressions, Neural Networks, and Monte Carlo Simulations.
