# TechLabs Barcelona
This repository contains projects and notebooks created during the Artificial Intelligence TechLabs Academy Track at TechLabs Barcelona. 

This project was created with Python 3.7.

### TechLabs_Final_Project.ipynb
This project is based on a kaggle competition (www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) aiming at analysing tweets and determining if they are related to a disaster or not. To perform this analysis, three datasets are needed: train.csv, test.csv and sample_submission.csv, which are provided in this repository. The aim is to analyze the tweets and predict their context using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
